# Client-Side Semantic Conventions for OpenTelemetry

A federated OpenTelemetry semantic convention registry for instrumentation that target
client-side applications running on mobile phones, browsers, desktop computers, or
any other end-user device.

This registry follows the federated model established by [OTEP 4815](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/oteps/4815-semantic-conventions-schema-v2.md) and augments
general OTel semantic conventions that are mostly defined with backend applications in
mind with ones that are unique to and common amongst client-side application platforms.

It contains YAMLs that defines the semantic conventions for namespaces that it owns
and the associated Markdown files for those conventions. It will host and publish
version-stamped schema URLs representing the public-facing surface of the manifest,
but it does not generate or publish language-specific binaries that make the hosted
conventions consumable in instrumentation.

## Scope

This registry is the umbrella for all client-side semantic conventions, including ones
that apply to only a single platform (browser, Android, iOS, desktop). Platform-specific
conventions live here rather than alongside their SDK implementations.

## Roadmap

We are still in the process of bootstrapping this repo. More details about the roadmap
will follow. If you are interested in participating, join the
